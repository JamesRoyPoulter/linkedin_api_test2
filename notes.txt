to tidy up:

1) one linked in sign in

3) current_user access to mentor search - this should work, current_user.mentor_search t/f. just needs to be rolled out across site.

4) try and build a fb oauth app

5) add in linkedin access

6) pull all data down yolo.

7) pull down the numebr of connections from the linkedin api, and pull down the profile url

9) js split skills search to browse/

10) on clicking someone's name display the show profile page for that user

11) one click add all people in warner yard

12) column sort

13) add mobile and email

14) table widths

15) stop thousands of searches

16) link to profile, need to link to individual user and pull all data associated with. dont do it through linkedin, do it through just accessing user. and filling fields basically. don't overcomplicate.

17) rails_12factor gem

18)   <div><%= link_to "Sign in with linkedin", user_omniauth_authorize_path(:linkedin_oauth2) %></div> from devise/reigstrations/new
